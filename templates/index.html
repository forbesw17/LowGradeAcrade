        Welcome to Low Grade Arcade! This is a website that has three classic
        games: Snake, Tetris, and Space Invaders. Each game has been recreated
        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website also has a sign-in/sign-up
        page. The website is a work in progress and will be updated with more
        games and features in the future.
