    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      This is a retro arcade website. It has three games: Snake, Pong, and Space
      Invaders. Each game is a classic and has been recreated using HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript. The website also has a sign-in/sign-up page. The website
      is a work in progress and will be updated with more games and features in
      the future.
