        This is a retro arcade website. It has three games: Snake, Pong, and
        Space Invaders. Each game is a classic and has been recreated using
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website also has a sign-in/sign-up page.
        The website is a work in progress and will be updated with more games
        and features in the future.
